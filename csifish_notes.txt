reference for 70% of security bugs are memory bugs

SeaSign: slow (single message signing takes 2 minutes)
SIKE: based on SIDH, insecure
CSIDH: hopefully secure
CSI-FiSH: fiat-shamir on CSIDH, hopefully secure
          record-breaking computation required, infeasible to scale security much farther
SCALLOP: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-31368-4_13
         hopes to replace CSIDH with easier to compute/control class-group structure to allow scaling of CSI-FiSH style signature schemes
         single class-group action computation takes 35 seconds, so entirely infeasible to use for now

Hashing:
- SHAKE256 - very slow on purpose

Finite field:
- efficient fundamental field operations mod p
- random sampling
- test suite

(Montgomery) Elliptic curve required operations:
- point inverse
- point doubling, addition, subtraction
- multiplication-by-m map
- random sampling (for key generation and supersingularity verification)
- isogeny action given ideal exponent vector
- velu's formulae

Reduction-mod-lattice
- class action from Z_n to vector of ideal exponents

For Merkle-variant, also need Merkle-tree implementation
